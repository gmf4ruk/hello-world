# hello-world
My first repository

Hello everyone!

It is my firt time using GitHub. I don't even know properly what to do with this web site but i understand that it is essential for a developer to get used to GitHub. And know I am trying to learn and get its logic. I was reading the guide named hello-world and it was all about it. Besides I have to do my cs101 assignment. Wish me luck!
